        <br>
        <br>
        <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"> <p style="color:blue;"> Part 1 </p> </h2>
        <br>
        <br> <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Our solar system was formed billions of years ago. It consists of numerous celestial bodies including planets, satellites, asteroids, comets, meteorites and a massive star. Our solar system forms a part of the Milky Way Galaxy. Various celestial bodies in our solar system revolve around the Sun directly or indirectly. </p>
        <br>
        <br><h3>The Formation of the Solar System</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">It is believed that around 4.6 billion years ago, the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud gave shape to our solar system. Major part of the collapsing mass collated at the centre, that formed the Sun. The remaining mass flattened into a proto planetary disk and formed the planets, satellites and other objects in the solar system. Planet Jupiter, the biggest planet in our solar system, contains major chunk of the remaining mass.</p>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Our solar system is believed to have evolved substantially since its inception. Many new moons have come into shape from the gases and dust around the planets. Several collisions among the celestial bodies have also occurred and still continue to occur thereby contributing to the evolution of the solar system.</p>
        <br>
        <br><h3>The Discovery of Planets</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">For thousands of years astronomers believed that Earth was stationary and formed the centre of the universe. It was in the 18th century that the astronomers accepted that Earth orbits around the Sun.</p>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">In 2nd millennium BC, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were identified by ancient Babylonian astronomers. Later, Nicolaus Copernicus also identified them. Uranus was discovered by famous astronomer, Sir William Herschel in 1781. Neptune was discovered by English astronomer and mathematician, John Couch Adams in the year 1846. It was in the year 1930 that the ninth planet, Pluto was discovered. Astronomer Clyde Tombaugh discovered Pluto which is now identified as a dwarf planet.</p>
        <br>
        <br> <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">The study of the universe and heavenly bodies is one of the most fascinating studies. Through continuous research, astronomers have found out several surprising facts about the universe and our solar system. Our solar system is ever evolving and newer facts are being discovered and studied by researchers year after year.</p>

        <br><h2 style="text-align:center;"> <p style="color:darkred;">  Part 2  </p> </h2>
        <br>
        <br><h3>Introduction</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Our solar system consists of eight planets that revolve around the Sun, which is central to our solar system. These planets have broadly been classified into two categories – inner planets and outer planets. There are four inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. The inner planets are closer to the Sun and smaller in size as compared to the outer planets. These are also referred to as the Terrestrial planets. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are termed as the outer planets. These are massive in size and are often referred to as Giant planets.</p>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Here is brief information about each of these planets:</p>
        <br>
        <br><h3>The Sun</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen Itc">The Sun is the only star on our solar system. It is stationary and the other objects in our solar system revolve around it. It is the most massive component of our solar system. Research states that it comprises of 99.86% of the entire mass of our solar system.</p>
        <br>
        <br><h3>The Planets</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">There are eight planets in the solar system. These are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. The planets have been divided into two groups – Terrestrial Planets and Giant Planets. Planets vary based on their size, geological features, mass, number of satellites and various other factors. No traces of life have been found on any planet apart from Earth.</p>
        <br>
        <br><h3>The Dwarf Planets</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">There are five dwarf planets in our solar system. These are Pluto, Ceres, Haumea, Eris and Makemake. While Ceres is situated in the asteroid belt others are located in the outer solar system. Dwarf planets are quite like the full size planets. The only difference is that the full size planets have cleared the objects in the area of their orbit whereas the dwarf planets have not.</p>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Astronomers claim that there are six other objects in our solar system that are akin to the dwarf planets. These may be officially recognized as dwarf planets in the times to come.</p>
        <br>
        <br><h3>The Moons</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">There are a total of 193 moons in our solar system as per a research conducted in the year 2008. Out of these, 185 moons orbit around the full size planets and 8 moons revolve around the dwarf planets. Moons come in various sizes and shapes. They differ from each other in various ways. Most of the moons are airless. However, there are some that have atmosphere. Some even have hidden oceans. Each planet has different number of moons. Earth has just one moon while Jupiter has the highest number of moons. It has a total of 79 moons. Moons orbit around their respective planets.</p>
        <br>
        <br><h3>Mercury</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">The smallest planet in our solar system, Mercury is also the closest to the Sun. Its geological features consist of lobed ridges and impact craters. Being closest to the Sun, Mercury’s temperature sores extremely high during the day time. It can go as high as 450 degree Celsius. Surprisingly, the nights here are freezing cold.</p>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Mercury has a diameter of 4,878 km. It does not have any natural satellite.</p>
        <br>
        <br><h3>Venus</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Venus is said to be the hottest planet of our solar system. It has a toxic atmosphere that traps heat. It is also the brightest planet and is visible to the naked eye. It has a thick silicate layer around an iron core which is similar to that of Earth. Astronomers have seen traces of internal geological activity on this planet.</p>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Venus has a diameter of 12,104 km. Just like Mars, Venus also does not have any natural satellite.</p>
        <br>
        <br><h3>Earth</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Earth is the largest inner planet. Two-third of this planet is covered with water. It is the only planet in our solar system where life is known to exist. Earth’s atmosphere, which is rich in nitrogen and oxygen, makes it fit for the survival of various species of flora and fauna. However, human activities are having negative impact on its atmosphere.</p>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Earth has a diameter of 12,760 km. It has one natural satellite, the moon.</p>
        <br>
        <br><h3>Mars</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Mars, the fourth planet from Sun, is often referred to as the Red Planet. The iron oxide present on this planet gives it a reddish appeal. The planet is cold and has geological features similar to that of Earth. This is the reason why it has captured the interest of astronomers like no other planet. Traces of frozen ice caps have been found on the planet.</p>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Mars has a diameter of 6,787 km and two natural satellites.</p>
        <br>
        <br><h3>Jupiter</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system. It has a strong magnetic field. It largely consists of helium and hydrogen. It has a Great Red Spot and cloud bands. A giant storm is believed to have raged here for hundreds of years.</p>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Jupiter has a diameter of 139,822 km and has as many as 79 natural satellites.</p>
        <br>
        <br><h3>Saturn</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Saturn is known for its ring system. These rings are made of tiny particles of ice and rock. Its atmosphere is quite like that of Jupiter as it is also largely composed of hydrogen and helium.</p>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Saturn has a diameter of 120,500 km. It has 62 natural satellites that are mainly composed of ice.</p>
        <br>
        <br><h3>Uranus</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Uranus, the seventh planet from Sun, is the lightest of all the giant, outer planets. It has a blue tint which is because of the presence of Methane in the atmosphere. Its core is colder than the other giant planets. The planet orbits on its side.</p>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Uranus has a diameter of 51,120 km and 27 natural satellites.</p>
        <br>
        <br><h3>Neptune</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">The last planet in our solar system, Neptune is also the coldest of all. It is around the same size as the Uranus but is much more massive and dense. Neptune’s atmosphere is composed of helium, hydrogen, methane and ammonia. It experiences extremely strong winds. It is the only planet in our solar system which is found by mathematical prediction.</p>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Neptune has a diameter of 49,530 km. It has 14 natural satellites.</p>
        <br>
        <br><h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <br>
        <br><p style="font-family:Kristen ITC">Scientists and astronomers have been studying our solar system for centuries and the findings are quite interesting. Various planets that form a part of our solar system have their own unique geological features and are different from each other in several ways.</p>
